# AI recruitment assistant

Final project for the Building AI course

## Summary
Recruitment and selection in organizations can be a lengthy, complex, and often biased process. AI can be a great ally for organizations when it comes to facilitating the recruitment and selection of CVs. It can also be useful for carrying out more diverse and inclusive recruitment, not excluding profiles at first glance.


## Background
Recruitment and selection in organizations can be a lengthy and complex process. Human resources teams are overwhelmed with interview scheduling, and the decision-making process, all of which can slow down hiring and impact the quality of recruitment and talent acquisition. Furthermore, unconscious biases in hiring decisions (based on gender, ethnicity) are common. This project will aim to automate key parts of the recruitment process, focusing on candidate matching, interview scheduling, and evaluating candidate responses, while minimizing human bias.
The challenges of recruitment and selection are extremely common. Every organization faces some version of these issues. Most of companies say they struggle to find candidates with the right skills. Furthermore, unconscious bias continues to be a significant issue in hiring.
I’m interested in how AI can solve real-world problems in a way that increases fairness and efficiency. I have a strong belief that AI can reduce human biases in decision-making, especially in processes like recruitment, where diversity and equity are crucial.


## How is it used?
The AI recruitment assistant would be used and affect:
HR Professionals and Recruiters and HR teams: To help the recruitment process, reduce time spent on screening resumes, and ensure candidates are a good fit for the role.
Job Seekers: Candidates can benefit from a more transparent and efficient hiring process where they are equally evaluated based on their qualifications and experience.
Organizations: Organizations could find high-quality candidates quickly and reducing hiring time.


## Data sources and AI methods
Data sources:
Resumes and CVs- Past resumes from previous job applicants will be used to train the model.
Job Descriptions- Skills and qualifications will be required to match candidates to roles.
Interview Data- Interview transcripts or video data (using speech-to-text technology) to analyze responses.
Employee Performance Data- Historical performance data can help refine the matching between candidates and the organization’s needs.
AI Techniques:
Natural Language Processing (NLP)- To analyze and extract information from resumes and job descriptions, NLP can be used for semantic matching and sentiment analysis.
Machine Learning Algorithms: Supervised learning techniques such as Logistic Regression.
Computer Vision (for video interviews): If the interview is conducted via video, AI video analysis can be used to analyze facial expressions, tone, and context of responses.
Chatbots for Screening: A conversational AI chatbot could be used for initial candidate interview.


## Challenges
Subjective Aspects of Hiring: While AI can help automate many aspects of recruitment, it cannot fully evaluate certain subjective qualities like soft skills.
Bias in Data
Personalization and Empathy: The emotional intelligence needed to gauge a candidate’s enthusiasm, creativity, and interpersonal skills still require human input.
